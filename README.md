## Abstract
===========
Kubik Koin (Qubicoin) is a renewable form of currency that is decentralized in such a way that it uses a moderated cryptograph, unlike other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and its variants, which use the Classic Algorithm. Meanwhile, this Kubik coin product uses modern cryptography with the Quantum Algorithm, namely Qubic. With Qubic's modernized cryptography Algorithms that continuously adapt to computing and other classic computing machines by trusting the Qubicoin repository in open sources that want it in such a way that the Database is distributed in such a way that it then spreads across nodes, P2P, VMvare, and engagement AI, IoT, ML, VR, Cloud Services and various other networks that are very suitable for the Quantum Financial System model, Banking Journal, Global Currency Market, and world financial services regulations. And the spread is expected to greatly influence currency exchange rates and can be seen significantly in the graph, an increase in positive activity in the market and influence the economic level of all levels of society.
# Quorum-State ($QSTATE)
> **The First Quantum-Superposition Quorum Blockchain.**

This project is a high-evolution fork from the original Qubicoin implementation, 
re-engineered to bridge Quorum-Based Computation with Quantum Superposition.

## Core Vision
Quorum-State aims to solve the Q-Day threat by integrating:
- **UPoW (Useful Proof of Work):** Training AI in quantum-simulated environments.
- **Superposition Consensus:** Leveraging 676 nodes to validate probabilistic quantum states.
- **Post-Quantum Security:** Lattice-based cryptography integration.

## Development Status
Current implementation is migrating from standard binary Quorum logic (Qubicoin) 
to Quantum-State Simulation.
